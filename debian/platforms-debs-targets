# config target:
#   an _config gets tacked on and used for the u-boot config
#
# package name:
#   underscores are not allowed in debian package names so
#   this is normally just config target with underscores replaced
#   with dashes 
#
# build target:
#   some targets do not do the right thing unless asked explicitly
#   specifically one must specify u-boot.imx for mx5x
#   use - for the case where no target should be passed
#
# install target(s):
#   list of files to include in deb
#
# config		package			build		install
